Data Cleaning
-------------
In machine learning, data cleaning, also known as data cleansing, data wrangling, or data preprocessing, is the crucial process of preparing raw data for analysis and modeling. It involves identifying and resolving issues with the data that could adversely affect the performance and accuracy of your machine learning models.
It involves-
1. Removing Null
2. FIlling the null values either with mean, median or any other value
3. Removing Duplicates
4. Removing unnecessary columns like index columns
5. Identifying and removing outliers
